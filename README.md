Question statement:

A taxi fleet consists of diesel and electric cars. For this exercise, we have data about the fuel
efficiency and current fuel (diesel or battery) level of all cars in the fleet. We would like to
calculate the range of the car

● For diesel cars, the fuel efficiency of each car is specified in km/l and the amount of fuel
remaining in the tank is specified in litres.
● For electric cars, efficiency is specified in W-h/km and the remaining battery charge is
specified as a percentage of the total battery energy currently remaining.
● Assume all electric cars have a battery capacity of 100 kW-h, and assume the fuel
efficiency is a constant for a given vehicle
